_**GARCH - LSTM Volatility Forecasting**_


Stock Market Volatility Forecasting (ARCH/GARCH + LSTM Hybrid):
This project combines statistical modeling (ARCH/GARCH) and deep learning (LSTM) to forecast stock market volatility.
The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models â€” GARCH captures short-term volatility clustering, while LSTM learns longer-term temporal dependencies.

Project Overview

Goal: Predict and analyze the volatility of financial time series (e.g., stock prices).
Techniques Used:
    ARCH/GARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)
